# Short Form Citations - Bluebook Rule 4

Complete guidance for id., supra, hereinafter, and other short forms per Bluebook 21st Edition.

## The Iron Law of Short Forms

<EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>
**NO SHORT FORM WITHOUT FULL CITATION FIRST.**

Every short form (id., supra, hereinafter) MUST point to a preceding full citation. If the full citation doesn't exist, the short form is meaningless.

**Verification gate:**
1. LOCATE full citation in document
2. VERIFY no ambiguity (only one source matches)
3. CHECK for intervening citations (for id.)
4. THEN use short form
</EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>

## Id. (Rule 4.1)

### When to Use Id.

Use id. when:
1. Citing the **immediately preceding authority**
2. **No intervening citations** since that authority
3. The preceding authority is in the **same footnote** or a **recent footnote**

### Basic Form

**Same page:**
```
1. Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483, 495 (1954).
2. Id.
```

**Different page:**
```
1. Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483, 495 (1954).
2. Id. at 496.
```

**Different section (statutes):**
```
1. 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (2018).
2. Id. § 1985.
```

### Id. Capitalization

| Position | Capitalization |
|----------|----------------|
| Beginning of citation sentence | *Id.* |
| Within citation clause | *id.* |
| After a signal | *id.* |

**Examples:**
```
Id. at 496.                           (beginning of sentence)
See id. at 496.                       (after signal)
See Brown, 347 U.S. at 495; id. at 496.  (within clause)
```

### When NOT to Use Id.

**Never use id. when:**

1. **Intervening citation exists:**
```
WRONG:
1. Brown, 347 U.S. at 495.
2. Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U.S. 537 (1896).
3. Id. at 496.  ← Would refer to Plessy, not Brown!

CORRECT:
3. Brown, 347 U.S. at 496.
```

2. **Preceding footnote has multiple sources:**
```
WRONG:
1. Brown, 347 U.S. at 495; Plessy, 163 U.S. at 540.
2. Id. at 496.  ← Ambiguous: which case?

CORRECT:
2. Brown, 347 U.S. at 496.
```

3. **Too many footnotes have passed:**

Use judgment—after five footnotes without citing the source, use full short form instead of id.

### Id. for Different Source Types

**Cases:**
```
Id.                    (same page)
Id. at 496.           (different page)
```

**Statutes:**
```
Id.                    (same section)
Id. § 1985.           (different section)
Id. § 1983(a).        (subsection of same section)
```

**Books:**
```
Id.                    (same page)
Id. at 50.            (different page)
```

**Articles:**
```
Id.                    (same page)
Id. at 2035.          (different page)
```

## Supra (Rule 4.2)

### When to Use Supra

Use supra to refer to a source fully cited in a **previous footnote**.

**Supra is appropriate for:**
- Books
- Articles
- Reports
- Most secondary sources

**Supra is NOT appropriate for:**
- Cases (use case short form instead)
- Statutes (use statutory short form instead)
- Constitutions
- Regulations

### Basic Form

```
[Author's last name], supra note [#], at [Page].
```

**Example:**
```
1. Cass R. Sunstein, On the Expressive Function of Law, 144 U. Pa. L. Rev. 2021, 2030 (1996).
...
15. Sunstein, supra note 1, at 2040.
```

### Supra Without Page

When referring to the work generally (not a specific page):
```
Sunstein, supra note 1.
```

### Multiple Works by Same Author

When the author has multiple cited works, use title to disambiguate:
```
1. Cass R. Sunstein, On the Expressive Function of Law, 144 U. Pa. L. Rev. 2021 (1996).
2. Cass R. Sunstein, The Cost-Benefit Revolution (2018).
...
15. Sunstein, supra note 1, at 2040.        (refers to article)
16. Sunstein, supra note 2, at 50.          (refers to book)
```

Or use hereinafter for clarity.

### Supra for Multi-Author Works

```
1. William N. Eskridge, Jr. & Philip P. Frickey, Cases and Materials on Legislation 200 (5th ed. 2014).
...
15. Eskridge & Frickey, supra note 1, at 250.
```

For three or more authors, use first author only:
```
1. Erwin Chemerinsky et al., Constitutional Law 150 (6th ed. 2019).
...
15. Chemerinsky, supra note 1, at 200.
```

## Hereinafter (Rule 4.2(b))

### When to Use Hereinafter

Use hereinafter when:
1. Title is unusually long or cumbersome
2. Multiple works by same author need disambiguation
3. Source would otherwise be ambiguous in short form

### Basic Form

Define in first citation:
```
[Full Citation] [hereinafter [Short Name]].
```

Use in subsequent citations:
```
[Short Name], supra note [#], at [Page].
```

### Examples

**Long title:**
```
1. U.S. Dep't of Health & Human Servs., The Health Consequences of Smoking—50 Years of Progress: A Report of the Surgeon General 100 (2014) [hereinafter Surgeon General's Report].
...
15. Surgeon General's Report, supra note 1, at 150.
```

**Multiple works by same author:**
```
1. Cass R. Sunstein, On the Expressive Function of Law, 144 U. Pa. L. Rev. 2021 (1996) [hereinafter Sunstein, Expressive Function].
2. Cass R. Sunstein, Cost-Benefit Analysis and the Environment, 115 Ethics 351 (2005) [hereinafter Sunstein, Cost-Benefit].
...
15. Sunstein, Expressive Function, supra note 1, at 2040.
16. Sunstein, Cost-Benefit, supra note 2, at 360.
```

### Hereinafter Placement

Always immediately after the citation, before any parenthetical:
```
CORRECT: ...100 (2014) [hereinafter Report].
WRONG:   ...100 [hereinafter Report] (2014).
```

## Short Forms for Cases (Rule 10.9)

**Cases do NOT use supra.** Use case-specific short forms instead.

### Basic Case Short Form

```
[One Party Name], [Vol.] [Reporter] at [Page].
```

**Example:**
```
1. Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483, 495 (1954).
...
15. Brown, 347 U.S. at 497.
```

### When Both Party Names Needed

Use both names when one party name is common or ambiguous:
```
Smith v. Jones, 500 F.3d at 105.
```

### Id. vs. Case Short Form

| Situation | Use |
|-----------|-----|
| Same case, no intervening cites | Id. at [Page] |
| Same case, intervening cites | Brown, 347 U.S. at [Page] |
| Different case | Full short form |

## Short Forms for Statutes (Rule 12.10)

### Id. for Statutes

```
1. 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (2018).
2. Id.                           (same section)
3. Id. § 1985.                   (different section in same title)
```

### Section Symbol Short Form

After full citation, within same discussion:
```
Section 1983 provides remedies for...
```

Or:
```
The statute, § 1983, was enacted...
```

### Named Act Short Form

```
1. Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000e to 2000e-17 (2018).
...
15. Civil Rights Act § 703.
```

## Infra (Rule 3.5)

### When to Use Infra

Use infra to refer to material appearing **later** in the document.

```
See infra Part II.A.
See infra note 45 and accompanying text.
```

### Infra vs. Supra

| Direction | Citation |
|-----------|----------|
| Earlier in document | supra |
| Later in document | infra |

### Cross-References

```
See supra notes 10-15 and accompanying text.
See infra Section III.
See supra Part I.B.2.
```

## Common Short Form Errors

### Id. Errors

### Supra Errors

| Error | Problem | Correction |
|-------|---------|------------|
| Supra for cases | Wrong source type | Use case short form |
| Supra for statutes | Wrong source type | Use statutory short form |
| Wrong footnote number | Reader can't find source | Verify note number |
| Missing "at" for pinpoint | Incomplete citation | Add "at [Page]" |

### Hereinafter Errors

| Error | Problem | Correction |
|-------|---------|------------|
| Hereinafter without supra | Incomplete short form | Include supra note # |
| Hereinafter not defined | Reader confused | Define in full citation |
| Hereinafter changed | Inconsistent | Use same short name throughout |

## Decision Flowchart

```
Need to cite a source you've cited before?

├── Is it a case?
│   ├── Immediately preceding, no intervening? → Id. at [Page]
│   └── Otherwise → [Party], [Vol.] [Reporter] at [Page]
│
├── Is it a statute?
│   ├── Immediately preceding, no intervening? → Id. or Id. § [#]
│   └── Otherwise → § [#] or [Name] § [#]
│
└── Is it a secondary source?
    ├── Immediately preceding, no intervening? → Id. at [Page]
    └── Otherwise → [Author], supra note [#], at [Page]
```
