### Special Parties

|-------|---------------|
| United States | U.S. (not "United States of America") |
| State as party | State v. Smith (not "People" unless officially so titled) |
| Government agency | Agency name or acronym if well-known |
| Relator | Omit relator in ex rel. unless necessary |

### Procedural Phrases

| Phrase | When to Use |
|--------|-------------|
| *In re* | Bankruptcy, probate, non-adversary proceedings |
| *Ex parte* | One-party proceedings |
| *Ex rel.* | Actions by relator (often omit relator) |

**Example:**

## Reporters (Rule 10.3)

### Federal Courts

| District Courts | F. Supp., F. Supp. 2d, F. Supp. 3d | 100 F. Supp. 3d 456 |

**Supreme Court preference:** Use U.S. Reports. If unavailable, use S. Ct., then L. Ed.

### State Courts

Use Table T1 for each state's official and regional reporter requirements.

**General rule:** Cite to official reporter if available, plus regional reporter if required by local practice.

**Example (New York):**
```

```

### Parallel Citations

2. State rule requires parallel citation

For law reviews, generally cite only to official reporter or regional reporter (not both).
