# Introductory Signals and Parentheticals - Bluebook Rule 1

Complete guidance for signals, parentheticals, and citation ordering per Bluebook 21st Edition.

## The Purpose of Signals

Signals communicate the **relationship** between the cited authority and the proposition in the text. Choosing the wrong signal misleads readers about how the source supports (or contradicts) your argument.

<EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>
## Signal Verification Gate

Before using ANY signal:
1. READ the source
2. IDENTIFY the proposition you're supporting
3. ASK: Does the source *directly state* or *implicitly support* the proposition?
4. SELECT signal based on actual relationship
5. VERIFY by re-reading source

**Using the wrong signal is misrepresentation. Verify every signal choice.**
</EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>

## Signal Categories (Rule 1.2)

### Signals That Show Support

#### [No Signal]

Use when the cited authority **directly states** the proposition.

```
The Constitution requires due process. U.S. Const. amend. XIV, § 1.
```

The source explicitly contains the proposition—no inference required.

#### *See*

Use when the cited authority **clearly supports** the proposition but does not **directly state** it. Reader must make a small inferential step.

```
The Due Process Clause protects certain unenumerated rights. See Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479 (1965).
```

*Griswold* supports this proposition but doesn't state it in these exact terms.

#### *E.g.,*

Use when the cited authority is **one of multiple** authorities that directly state the proposition. Signals that you're not citing all supporting authorities.

```
Federal courts have jurisdiction over diversity cases. E.g., 28 U.S.C. § 1332 (2018).
```

#### *See, e.g.,*

Combines *see* and *e.g.*—the cited authority clearly supports but doesn't directly state the proposition, and there are other supporting authorities.

```
Courts routinely dismiss claims for lack of standing. See, e.g., Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555 (1992).
```

#### *Accord*

Use after citing one authority, to add additional authorities that state or support the same proposition.

```
Due process requires notice. Smith v. Jones, 500 U.S. 1 (1990); accord Doe v. Roe, 400 U.S. 50 (1985).
```

#### *See also*

Use when the cited authority constitutes **additional support** for the proposition. The additional material is helpful but not directly on point.

```
Libel claims require proof of falsity. See New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254 (1964). See also Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., 418 U.S. 323 (1974) (extending actual malice standard).
```

#### *Cf.*

Use when the cited authority supports a proposition **by analogy**. The source supports a similar but distinct proposition.

```
Age discrimination claims require disparate treatment. Cf. Hazen Paper Co. v. Biggins, 507 U.S. 604 (1993) (holding that pension-status discrimination is not age discrimination).
```

**Always use a parenthetical** with *cf.* to explain the analogy.

### Signals That Suggest a Comparison

#### *Compare ... with ...*

Use to compare authorities that illustrate a proposition through their contrast.

```
Compare Smith v. Jones, 500 F.3d 100 (9th Cir. 2007) (finding jurisdiction), with Doe v. Roe, 400 F.3d 50 (5th Cir. 2005) (finding no jurisdiction).
```

Always include parentheticals explaining the comparison.

### Signals That Indicate Contradiction

#### *Contra*

Use when the cited authority **directly states** the opposite of the proposition.

```
Some courts hold that X is required. Contra Brown v. White, 500 U.S. 1 (1990).
```

*Brown* directly states that X is not required.

#### *But see*

Use when the cited authority **clearly supports** a contrary proposition but doesn't directly state it.

```
The statute requires intent. But see Smith v. Jones, 500 F.3d 100 (9th Cir. 2007) (applying negligence standard).
```

#### *But cf.*

Use when the cited authority supports a contrary proposition **by analogy**.

```
Strict liability does not apply to services. But cf. Restatement (Third) of Torts: Products Liability § 19 (Am. L. Inst. 1998) (applying strict liability to product-related services).
```

**Always use a parenthetical** with *but cf.*

### Signal for Background

#### *See generally*

Use when the cited authority provides **helpful background** but does not directly support the proposition.

```
For an overview of Fourth Amendment doctrine, see generally Orin S. Kerr, An Equilibrium-Adjustment Theory of the Fourth Amendment, 125 Harv. L. Rev. 476 (2011).
```

## Signal Order Within a Citation Sentence (Rule 1.3)

When multiple signals appear in a single citation sentence, they must appear in this order:

1. [no signal]
2. *E.g.,*
3. *Accord*
4. *See*
5. *See also*
6. *Cf.*
7. *Compare ... with ...*
8. *Contra*
9. *But see*
10. *But cf.*
11. *See generally*

**Separate signal groups with semicolons:**
```
U.S. Const. art. I, § 8; see Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483 (1954); cf. Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U.S. 537 (1896).
```

## Citation Sentences vs. Citation Clauses (Rule 1.1)

### Citation Sentences

A citation sentence follows a textual sentence and cites authority for that sentence.

```
The Constitution requires due process. U.S. Const. amend. XIV, § 1.
```

**Capitalize** signals at the beginning of citation sentences.

### Citation Clauses

A citation clause is embedded within a textual sentence or refers to only part of it.

```
The Supreme Court has held, see Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483 (1954), that separate is inherently unequal.
```

**Do not capitalize** signals in citation clauses.

### Punctuation

| Position | Punctuation |
|----------|-------------|
| End of citation sentence | Period |
| Between citations in same sentence | Semicolon |
| Citation clause (embedded) | Commas on both sides |

## Parentheticals (Rule 1.5)

### When Parentheticals Are Required

**Always required with:**
- *Cf.*
- *But cf.*
- *Compare ... with ...*
- Any source that doesn't directly state the proposition

**Strongly recommended with:**
- *See*
- *See also*
- *But see*

### Parenthetical Form

Begin with a present participle or quoted material:

**Present participle:**
```
(holding that separate is inherently unequal)
(finding no constitutional violation)
(noting the difficulty of the issue)
(rejecting defendant's argument)
```

**Quoted material:**
```
("Separate educational facilities are inherently unequal.")
```

### Parenthetical Content

Explain **what the source says** or **how it supports** the proposition:

```
Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483 (1954) (holding that separate educational facilities are inherently unequal under the Equal Protection Clause).
```

### Weight of Authority Parentheticals

Indicate procedural posture or authorship:

```
(en banc)
(per curiam)
(plurality opinion)
(Thomas, J., dissenting)
(Stevens, J., concurring in the judgment)
(5-4 decision)
```

### Order of Multiple Parentheticals

1. Weight of authority (en banc, per curiam)
2. "Quoting" or "citing" information
3. Explanatory parenthetical

```
Smith v. Jones, 500 F.3d 100 (9th Cir. 2007) (en banc) (quoting Roe v. Doe, 400 F.3d 50, 60 (5th Cir. 2005)) (holding that strict liability applies).
```

## Order of Authorities Within a Signal (Rule 1.4)

### General Order of Authority Types

When citing multiple authorities with the same signal:

1. Constitutions (federal, then state alphabetically)
2. Statutes (federal, then state alphabetically)
3. Treaties
4. Cases (federal by court level, then state alphabetically)
5. Legislative materials
6. Administrative and executive materials
7. Resolutions, decisions, and regulations of intergovernmental organizations
8. Records, briefs, and petitions
9. Secondary materials
10. Cross-references to the author's own work

### Order of Cases

**Federal courts (by court hierarchy):**
1. Supreme Court
2. Courts of Appeals (by circuit number)
3. District Courts (alphabetically by state)
4. Other federal courts

**State courts:**
Alphabetically by state, then by court hierarchy within each state.

**Within same court:**
Reverse chronological order (most recent first).

### Example

```
See U.S. Const. amend. XIV; 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (2018); Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483 (1954); Smith v. Jones, 500 F.3d 100 (9th Cir. 2007); Doe v. Roe, 400 F.3d 50 (5th Cir. 2005).
```

## String Citations (Rule 1.4)

### When to Use String Citations

String citations (multiple authorities in one citation sentence) are appropriate when:
1. Showing a trend or widespread agreement
2. Demonstrating a circuit split
3. Providing comprehensive authority for an important proposition

### When to Avoid String Citations

Avoid string citations when:
1. One strong authority suffices
2. The additional authorities add no new support
3. The string is so long readers will skip it

**Quality over quantity.** Cite the most authoritative sources; don't pad with marginal authorities.

### Formatting String Citations

Separate authorities with semicolons:
```
See Smith v. Jones, 500 F.3d 100 (9th Cir. 2007); Doe v. Roe, 400 F.3d 50 (5th Cir. 2005); Brown v. White, 300 F.3d 25 (2d Cir. 2003).
```

## Common Signal Errors

### Choosing the Wrong Signal

| Error | Correct Signal | Explanation |
|-------|----------------|-------------|
| [no signal] when source doesn't directly state | *See* | Source supports but doesn't state proposition |
| *See* when source directly states | [no signal] | No inference needed |
| *Cf.* without parenthetical | *Cf.* (...) | Always explain the analogy |
| *See generally* for direct support | *See* or [no signal] | Reserve for background |

### Signal Capitalization Errors

| Error | Correction |
|-------|------------|
| see Smith v. Jones | *See* Smith v. Jones (sentence start) |
| See id. | *see* id. (after another signal) |

### Missing Parentheticals

| Error | Correction |
|-------|------------|
| Cf. Smith v. Jones... | Cf. Smith v. Jones... (explaining the analogy) |
| Compare X with Y. | Compare X (point A) with Y (contrasting point). |

## Rationalization Table - STOP If You Think:

| Thought | Reality | Do Instead |
|---------|---------|------------|
| "No signal is fine here" | Source may not directly state proposition | CHECK: Does it say exactly this? |
| "*See* is always safe" | *See* implies inference; wrong if direct | VERIFY: Direct statement vs. support |
| "Parenthetical is optional" | For *cf.*, *compare*, it's required | ADD parenthetical explaining relationship |
| "Order doesn't matter" | Wrong order confuses readers | FOLLOW Rule 1.4 ordering |
| "More citations = stronger" | Padding weakens credibility | CITE strongest authorities only |

## Verification Checklist

Before finalizing signals and parentheticals:

- [ ] Signal accurately reflects source's relationship to proposition
- [ ] [No signal] used only when source directly states proposition
- [ ] *See* used for clear support requiring inference
- [ ] *Cf.* and *but cf.* have explanatory parentheticals
- [ ] *Compare ... with ...* has parentheticals for both sources
- [ ] Signal is capitalized correctly for position
- [ ] Authorities within signal are in correct order
- [ ] Parentheticals begin with present participle or quotation
- [ ] Weight of authority parentheticals appear first
- [ ] String citations are warranted (not padding)
