/* pipeline_config.sas — THE universe. Both legs read this file and only this file.
 *
 * %include'd by build_meetings.sas (item-level leg), stage_npx_link.sas
 * (fund-level leg) and merge_panel.sas (the join).
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
 * --------------------
 * The two legs used to carry their own date windows and filters:
 *     build_meetings.sas    2003-2024, voteresult in ('Pass','Fail'), 5 meetingtypes
 *     stage_npx_link.sas    2005-2025, no voteresult filter, no meetingtype filter
 * Nothing detected the disagreement. Widening the meeting-type filter — which
 * this project has already done once — changes the item universe, and under
 * split config the ownership leg and the N-PX leg would silently be built over
 * DIFFERENT sets of items. The only thing that would have caught it is a
 * row-count assertion in somebody else's downstream code.
 *
 * Change the window or the filters HERE. merge_panel.sas asserts at the end of
 * the run that the two legs actually agree; if you edit a filter in one script
 * instead of here, the pipeline fails rather than producing a quietly wrong panel.

 *
 * Two things to note before reconciling anything:
 *   - The item frame shrinks by 136,040 items. Any N-PX vote-row total quoted
 *     against the UNFILTERED universe (144,375,860 for 2005-2025) will NOT match
 *     a run made with these filters. Reconcile against a count taken under the
 *     same config, or set MEETINGTYPES/VOTERESULTS to admit everything.
 *   - fanout drops 230 -> 11 because excluding 'Pending' removes most of the
 *     versioning pairs that make vavoteresults non-unique on itemonagendaid.
