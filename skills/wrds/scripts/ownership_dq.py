"""
Data-quality detectors for holdings panels (Thomson/Refinitiv S12 & S34, SEC 13F, N-PX).

Stdlib only. Every detector takes a sequence of record dicts -- exactly what
`df.to_dict("records")` gives you -- so it runs in CI with no dependencies and on a
real parquet panel through a one-line adapter.

Each detector answers a question a *reviewer* would ask of an ownership panel, and each
is grounded in a defect that was either measured on the mirror panel or documented by
WRDS Research. See `references/tfn-ownership.md` -> "Known Data Defects" for the
citations and for what WRDS says the fix is (in several cases: there is no clean fix).

The detectors are firm-agnostic by construction. AAPL (permno 14593) is where these
defects were found -- and, not coincidentally, the running example in WRDS's own splits
note -- but nothing here is specialized to it.

Conventions
-----------
Every detector returns a list of `Finding`. An empty list means "clean". Callers assert
on the list, so a detector never raises on ordinary bad data -- only on malformed input.

Periods are `datetime.date` (quarter-end) or ISO "YYYY-MM-DD" strings; both are accepted
and normalized. Records with a None metric are skipped, not treated as zero -- a missing
quarter and a zero quarter are different defects and conflating them hides both.
