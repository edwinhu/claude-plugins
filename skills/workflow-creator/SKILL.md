## Mode 1: Create New Workflow

### Step 1: Ground in Philosophy

Read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/PHILOSOPHY.md`. Every workflow must address: phased decomposition, gates (deterministic or judgment-based), independent verification, iteration strategy, and two entry points.

### Step 2: Interview

Use AskUserQuestion to understand the domain:

1. **What kind of work?** (code, data, writing, research, other)
2. **What's the deliverable?** (working feature, analysis report, polished document, etc.)
3. **What are the common failure modes?** (skipping tests, shallow analysis, weak arguments, etc.)
4. **When does drift happen?** (implementation without design, conclusions without evidence, etc.)
5. **How should iteration work?** (one-shot with verification, serial hypothesis testing, parallel exploration, agent team review)

### Step 3: Propose Phase Decomposition

Design phases where each phase has:
- **Name** - verb-noun (e.g., explore-codebase, design-approach)
- **Responsibility** - ONE question this phase answers
- **Gate condition** - verifiable exit criterion (file exists, test passes, artifact contains X)
- **Enforcement needs** - high/medium/low based on drift risk

Present 2-3 topologies to the user:
- **Linear** - phase 1 → phase 2 → ... → phase N (best for predictable work)
- **Branching** - routing based on input type (best for varied work like writing)
- **Iterative** - phases with loops (best for exploratory work like DS)

### Iteration Topology

Based on the interview answer about iteration, assign each phase an iteration strategy:

| Strategy | When to Use | Implementation |
|----------|------------|----------------|
| **One-shot + verify** | Clear specs, low ambiguity | Single subagent, run tests, move on |
| **Serial hypothesis** | Debugging, root cause analysis | Fresh subagent per iteration, HYPOTHESES.md as memory, progress-gated escalation |
| **Parallel exploration** | Multiple valid approaches, robustness checking | Spawn N subagents simultaneously, converge findings in state file |
| **Agent team** | Output needs multi-faceted review | Specialized reviewer subagents in parallel (e.g., copy + critic + fact-check), consolidate in REVIEW.md |

**Exit conditions by strategy:**

| Strategy | Exit Gate | Escalate When |
|----------|-----------|---------------|
| One-shot | Test passes | Test fails after fix attempt |
| Serial | New findings stop emerging | 3+ consecutive failures, repeated hypotheses |
| Parallel | Findings converge | Results contradictory, no convergence |
| Agent team | Reviewers converge | Unresolvable disagreement on direction |

**Key principle:** The agent never declares its own completion. Tests pass, findings converge, or the human approves.

### Step 4: Apply Enforcement Patterns

Read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/lib/references/enforcement-checklist.md`.

For each phase, score which of the 12 patterns are needed:
- **High-drift phases** (implementation, verification): Iron Laws, Rationalization Tables, Gate Functions, Honesty Framing
- **Medium-drift phases** (design, review): Gate Functions, Red Flags, Staged Review Loops
- **Low-drift phases** (brainstorm, exploration): Red Flags only (creative phases need freedom)

Generate the specific enforcement content:
- Write Iron Laws with `<EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>` tags
- Build Rationalization Tables from the failure modes identified in Step 2
- Define Red Flags + STOP for each phase's common wrong-path indicators

### Step 5: Design Two Entry Points

Every workflow exposes exactly **two** user-facing commands. Everything else is internal.

| Entry Point | Purpose | Example |
|-------------|---------|---------|
| **Entry** (start fresh) | Begins a new episode, runs brainstorm phase first | `/dev`, `/ds`, `/writing` |
| **Midpoint** (re-enter) | Re-enters a running episode, diagnoses and routes to the right phase | `/dev-debug`, `/ds-fix`, `/writing-revise` |

**Why two:** The user never needs to know which internal phase to invoke. Entry starts fresh. Midpoint diagnoses what's wrong and routes.

#### Midpoint Constraint Loading

The entry point runs sequentially — each phase loads its constraints and passes context forward. The midpoint can't rely on that. It may run in a new session, after context compression, or hours after the last edit. Prior constraints are gone.

**The midpoint must be self-contained.** It loads every constraint layer it needs before touching the work:

```
/writing-revise loads:
  1. ACTIVE_WORKFLOW.md    → workflow state (what phase, what style)
  2. PRECIS.md, OUTLINE.md → structural intent (what we're building)
  3. ai-anti-patterns      → universal constraints (no AI-smell)
  4. domain skill           → domain constraints
  THEN: check the draft against all four layers

/dev-debug loads:
  1. HYPOTHESES.md          → what's been tried
  2. LEARNINGS.md           → accumulated knowledge
  THEN: spawn fresh subagent for next investigation iteration

/ds-fix loads:
  1. SPEC.md, PLAN.md       → objectives and task breakdown
  2. LEARNINGS.md            → pipeline state and observations
  3. output-first protocol   → verification enforcement
  THEN: diagnose and route to fix path
```

**Critical rule:** Any phase that evaluates quality must load the full constraint set, not a summary of it. Summaries enable reward hacking — the agent checks against a 4-item summary, finds no issues, and reports "all checks pass" when the full rules would have caught problems. The fix: `Read()` the actual skill before checking.

### Step 6: Generate Workflow Files

Create the following artifacts:
1. **Entry command** (`skills/[name]/SKILL.md`) — routes to first phase
2. **Midpoint command** (`skills/[name]-fix/SKILL.md` or `skills/[name]-debug/SKILL.md`) — self-contained re-entry
3. **Phase skills** (`lib/skills/[name]-[phase]/SKILL.md`) — one per phase, internal only
4. **Wire up transitions** — each phase ends by reading the next phase's skill

Present complete file list for user approval before writing.

## Mode 2: Audit Existing Workflow

### Step 1: Read the Workflow

Read the workflow's entry command and ALL phase skills. Build a map of phases, transitions, and enforcement.

### Step 2: Score Against Core Principles

**Phased decomposition:**
- Does each phase have a single responsibility?
- Are phase boundaries clear?
- Can phases be executed out of order? (they shouldn't be)

**Gates (deterministic or judgment-based):**
- Are gates machine-verifiable where possible? (file exists, test passes)
- For subjective domains, are judgment gates explicit? (agent-assessed or human-assessed)
- Or are they just prose? ("ensure quality is high")
- Are there ungated transitions?

**Independent verification:**
- Is verification structurally independent from implementation? (fresh subagent, not self-review)
- Does the verifier see only spec + output, not the implementation journey?
- For subjective output, are there multiple specialized reviewers? (team topology)
- Is self-review ever the final gate? (it shouldn't be)

**Two entry points:**
- Does the workflow have both an entry (start fresh) and midpoint (re-enter)?
- Is the midpoint self-contained? (loads all constraints, doesn't depend on prior phases)
- Does the midpoint load full skills, not summaries?

**Iteration strategy:**
- Does each phase have an appropriate iteration topology? (one-shot, serial, parallel, team)
- Are exit conditions structural (tests, convergence, human approval) not honor-system (promises)?

### Step 3: Score Against Enforcement Checklist

Read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/lib/references/enforcement-checklist.md`.

For each of the 12 patterns, score:
- **Present** - pattern exists and is well-implemented
- **Weak** - pattern exists but is insufficient (e.g., soft language instead of Iron Law)
- **Absent** - pattern is missing where it should exist

Identify the highest-drift phases with the weakest enforcement - these are the critical gaps.

### Step 4: Output Audit Report

Format:

```
## Audit: [Workflow Name]

### Architecture Scores
- Phased decomposition: [score] - [notes]
- Gates (deterministic/judgment): [score] - [notes]
- Independent verification: [score] - [notes]
- Two entry points: [score] - [notes]
- Iteration strategy: [score] - [notes]

### Enforcement Coverage
| Pattern | Phase 1 | Phase 2 | ... | Phase N |
|---------|---------|---------|-----|---------|
| Iron Laws | ✅/⚠️/❌ | ... | ... | ... |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

### Critical Gaps
1. [Highest priority gap + recommendation]
2. [Second priority gap + recommendation]
...

### Recommendations
[Specific, actionable changes]
```

## Mode 3: Improve Workflow

### Step 1: Identify Gaps

Take audit findings (from Mode 2) or user-identified issues. List each gap with its severity.

### Step 2: Generate Fixes

For each gap, generate the specific addition:

- **Missing Iron Law** → Write the law with `<EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>` tags and strong framing
- **Missing Rationalization Table** → Identify 5-10 common excuses for that phase, write Excuse → Reality → Do Instead table
- **Weak gate** → Propose verifiable condition (file exists, content contains X, command output matches Y)
- **Self-review instead of independent verification** → Replace with fresh subagent reviewer that sees only spec + output, or team of specialized reviewers for subjective output
- **Missing Red Flags** → Identify 3-5 wrong-path indicators for the phase

### Step 3: Present Changes

Show each proposed change in context (which file, where in the file, what's added). Get user approval before applying.

### Step 4: Apply Changes

Edit the skill files with the approved changes. Verify each file is syntactically valid after editing.

<EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>
## Iron Laws of Workflow Creation

### NO WORKFLOW WITHOUT PHILOSOPHY
Every workflow must trace back to PHILOSOPHY.md. If you can't explain how a phase serves phased decomposition, gates, or adversarial review, the phase doesn't belong.

### NO PHASE WITHOUT A GATE
Every phase needs a gate — deterministic (test passes, file exists) or judgment-based (agent/human evaluates quality). Use the strongest gate available for the domain. No gate = not a real phase.

### NO HIGH-DRIFT PHASE WITHOUT ENFORCEMENT
Identify where the agent is most tempted to shortcut. Enforce hardest there. Implementation and verification phases ALWAYS need Iron Laws.
</EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>

## Red Flags - STOP If You Catch Yourself:

| Action | Why Wrong | Do Instead |
|---|---|---|
| Creating a workflow without reading PHILOSOPHY.md | You'll miss the foundational principles | Read it first, every time |
| Skipping the user interview | You'll design for an imagined domain, not the real one | Ask the five questions |
| Writing soft language instead of Iron Laws | LLMs ignore polite suggestions | Use strong framing with EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT tags |
| Proposing ungated phase transitions | Quality will die at the ungated boundary | Define a verifiable gate condition |
| Designing all phases with equal enforcement | Drift risk varies by phase | Score enforcement density per phase |

## Rationalization Table

| Excuse | Reality | Do Instead |
|---|---|---|
| "This workflow is simple, doesn't need enforcement" | Simple workflows drift fastest because the agent thinks it can shortcut | Add enforcement proportional to drift risk |
| "Iron Laws feel too aggressive" | LLMs ignore polite suggestions. Strong framing works. | Write the Iron Law. It will be ignored if weakened. |
| "Not every phase needs a gate" | Ungated phases are where quality dies | Define a verifiable gate condition |
| "The user will catch errors in review" | Relying on human review defeats the purpose of the workflow | Build adversarial review INTO the workflow |
| "I'll add enforcement later" | Later never comes. Enforcement debt compounds. | Add it now, refine through use |
| "This domain is different, dev patterns don't apply" | The three pillars are universal. Enforcement density varies, principles don't. | Apply pillars, adjust density |
