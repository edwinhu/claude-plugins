# LSEG Data Library

Access financial data from LSEG (London Stock Exchange Group), formerly Refinitiv, via the `lseg.data` Python library.

## Query Enforcement

### IRON LAW: NO DATA CLAIM WITHOUT SAMPLE INSPECTION

Before claiming ANY LSEG query succeeded, follow these steps:
1. **VALIDATE** field names exist (check prefixes: TR., CF_)
2. **VALIDATE** RIC symbology is correct (.O, .N, .L, .T)
3. **EXECUTE** the query
4. **INSPECT** sample rows with `.head()` or `.sample()`
5. **VERIFY** critical columns are not NULL
6. **VERIFY** date range matches expectations
7. **CLAIM** success only after all checks pass

This is not negotiable. Skipping result inspection is NOT HELPFUL — the user builds analysis on data with undetected quality problems.

### LSEG API Facts

- The API does not raise errors for invalid field names or wrong RICs — it returns empty results or NULL columns. Treating returned rows as correct data is an unverified claim presented as fact: inspect for NULLs, wrong dates, and invalid values before returning anything.
- Field-name typos are common and fail silently (TR.EPS vs TR.Eps). Validate field names against the documentation before executing.
- User-supplied RICs often carry the wrong exchange suffix. Verify against the RIC Symbology section (`.O`, `.N`, `.L`, `.T`) before querying.
- Market data has T-1 availability — today's data arrives tomorrow. Querying through today produces silent gaps; see the Date Awareness section.
- Rate limits bind per session (500 requests/minute) and per request (`get_data()` 10,000 data points, `get_history()` 3,000 rows) — many small queries still hit the session cap. Batch instead of looping.

### Red Flags — STOP If About To:

- Execute a query without validating field names and RIC suffixes first → STOP. The API will not error for you.
- Return a dataframe without `.head()` or `.sample()` inspection → STOP. Handing over uninspected data gives the user undetected quality problems — unhelpful on its own terms.

### Data Validation Checklist

Before EVERY data retrieval claim, verify the following:

**For `ld.get_data()` (fundamentals/ESG):**
- [ ] Field names use correct prefix (TR. for Refinitiv)
- [ ] RIC symbology verified (correct exchange suffix)
- [ ] Result inspection: `.head()` or `.sample()` executed
- [ ] NULL check on critical fields (e.g., revenue, EPS)
- [ ] Row count verification (is result size reasonable?)
- [ ] Date context verified (fiscal periods, as-of dates)

**For `ld.get_history()` (time series):**
- [ ] Field names are valid (OPEN, HIGH, LOW, CLOSE, VOLUME, or CF_ prefixes)
- [ ] Start/end dates specified explicitly
- [ ] Date range adjusted for T-1 availability (market data lag)
- [ ] Result inspection: check first and last rows
- [ ] NULL check on OHLCV fields
- [ ] Date continuity check (gaps in trading days expected, but not in date sequence)

**For `symbol_conversion.Definition()` (mapping):**
- [ ] Input identifier type specified correctly
- [ ] Result inspection: verify mapped values exist
- [ ] NULL check (some securities may not have all identifiers)

**For ALL queries:**
- [ ] Rate limits considered (batch if >10k data points)
- [ ] Session management: `open_session()` at start, `close_session()` at end
- [ ] Error handling: try/except for network failures
- [ ] Sample inspection BEFORE claiming data is ready

## Quick Start

To get started with LSEG Data Library, initialize a session and execute queries:

```python
import lseg.data as ld

# Initialize session
ld.open_session()

# Get fundamentals
df = ld.get_data(
    universe=[‘AAPL.O’, ‘MSFT.O’],
    fields=[‘TR.CompanyName’, ‘TR.Revenue’, ‘TR.EPS’]
)
print(df.head())  # Inspect sample data

# Get historical prices
prices = ld.get_history(
    universe=’AAPL.O’,
    fields=[‘OPEN’, ‘HIGH’, ‘LOW’, ‘CLOSE’, ‘VOLUME’],
    start=‘2023-01-01’,
    end=‘2023-12-31’
)
print(prices.head())  # Inspect sample data

# Close session
ld.close_session()
```

## Authentication

### On this setup: use the agenix secret

Credentials live in agenix as `lseg-credentials`, decrypted to
`$LSEG_CREDENTIALS_FILE` (mode 400). It is a shell-sourceable file, so **source
it, do not `cat` it into a variable**:

```bash
set -a; . "$LSEG_CREDENTIALS_FILE"; set +a   # exports LSEG_APP_KEY / LSEG_USERNAME / LSEG_PASSWORD
```

**THE VARIABLE NAMES DO NOT MATCH THE LIBRARY'S.** The secret exports `LSEG_*`;
everything below documents `RDP_*`. You must map them at the call site. Reading
this section and exporting `RDP_APP_KEY` from a file that defines `LSEG_APP_KEY`
gets you an empty environment and a session that fails on first query.

Before 2026-07-27 these existed only as plaintext in `mbp:~/projects/svb/.envrc`,
so anything running on another machine had no credentials at all. If a lookup
comes back empty, check that host's rebuild is current before concluding the
account is unentitled.

### `platform.Password` DOES NOT EXIST

The config-file example below hides the programmatic form, and the obvious guess
is wrong. In `lseg-data` 2.1.1 the class is **`GrantPassword`**:

```python
import lseg.data as ld
from lseg.data.session import platform

s = platform.Definition(
        app_key=os.environ["LSEG_APP_KEY"],
        grant=platform.GrantPassword(username=os.environ["LSEG_USERNAME"],
                                     password=os.environ["LSEG_PASSWORD"]),
    ).get_session()
s.open()
ld.session.set_default(s)
```

`platform` exports exactly three names — `ClientCredentials`, `Definition`,
`GrantPassword`. Check `dir()` before trusting a class name from the docs.

### ONE concurrent platform session — pass `signon_control=True`

The machine ID allows a single concurrent platform session, and the library
default is `signon_control=False`, which does not queue — it fails:

```
LDError: You authorised with signon_control=False. Session quota is reached.
If you want to open session close the previous opened.
```

Any earlier session that was not closed cleanly (a crashed script, another shell,
a background job) holds the quota until it times out. Pass `signon_control=True`
to take the signon over instead:

```python
s = platform.Definition(
        app_key=os.environ["LSEG_APP_KEY"],
        grant=platform.GrantPassword(username=os.environ["LSEG_USERNAME"],
                                     password=os.environ["LSEG_PASSWORD"]),
        signon_control=True,          # <- take over rather than fail
    ).get_session()
s.open()
if str(s.open_state) != "OpenState.Opened":     # open() does not raise; see above
    raise RuntimeError(f"session failed: {s.open_state}")
ld.session.set_default(s)
```

Corollary: **two local scripts cannot query at once.** If you need a second
concurrent path — an interactive query while a long batch runs — use Codebook,
which authenticates as a separate `DesktopSession` and does not draw on this
quota (see Refinitiv Codebook below).

### `open_session()` DOES NOT RAISE ON FAILURE

With no config and no credentials it falls back to a **desktop** session, tries
`http://localhost:9000/api/handshake` (LSEG Workspace running locally), logs the
connection failure, and **returns normally**. The error only surfaces on the
first query as `ValueError: Session is not opened`.

So `open_session()` returning is NOT evidence of a session. This is the same
silent-failure shape as the Iron Law above, one layer earlier: verify by issuing
a cheap query (`TR.PriceClose` on a liquid RIC) and inspecting the value.

### Config file / environment variables (upstream documentation)

Configure LSEG authentication using either a config file or environment variables.

### Config File Method

Create `lseg-data.config.json`:
```json
{
  “sessions”: {
    “default”: “platform.ldp”,
    “platform”: {
      “ldp”: {
        “app-key”: “YOUR_APP_KEY”,
        “username”: “YOUR_MACHINE_ID”,
        “password”: “YOUR_PASSWORD”
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Environment Variables Method

Set the following environment variables for LSEG authentication:

```bash
# Configure LSEG credentials via environment variables
export RDP_USERNAME=”YOUR_MACHINE_ID”
export RDP_PASSWORD=”YOUR_PASSWORD”
export RDP_APP_KEY=”YOUR_APP_KEY”
```

### Refinitiv Codebook

Interactive JupyterLab environment with pre-configured LSEG access:

- **URL**: `https://workspace.refinitiv.com/codebook/`
- **Environment**: JupyterHub with Python 3.8, pre-installed `refinitiv.data` library
- **Session**: Auto-authenticated via Workspace credentials (`{name=’codebook’}`)

```python
# In Codebook, session opens automatically with Workspace auth
import refinitiv.data as rd
rd.open_session()  # Returns session with name=’codebook’

# Query data immediately
df = rd.news.get_headlines(‘R:AAPL.O AND SUGGAC’, count=10)
```

**Note**: Codebook uses `refinitiv.data` (older name) rather than `lseg.data`. Both APIs are equivalent.

**Confirmed working 2026-07-27.** `rd.open_session()` there returns a
**`DesktopSession` named `codebook`** — a different session class from the
`PlatformSession` a local `lseg-data` script opens against the RDP machine ID.
Two practical consequences:

- **It does not consume the one-session platform quota** (see Authentication
  above), so Codebook can be queried while a local batch is running.
- **It is not better entitled.** Same user, different auth path, but identical
  content: spot-checked on short interest, where Codebook returned IBM
  33,088,057 and TXN 2025-03-31 16,647,062 — the same values to the digit as the
  platform session — and returned empty for the same delisted RICs. Do not reach
  for Codebook expecting data the API refuses; see `references/short-interest.md`.

### Driving Codebook programmatically (CDP)

Codebook is a JupyterLab in the browser, so it can be driven over CDP without
clicking, via the Jupyter REST + WebSocket API. One trap makes this fail
silently on the first try:

**The kernel WebSocket host is NOT the page host.** Read `wsUrl` from the
`jupyter-config-data` element rather than assuming `location.host` — it points at
`wss://amers1-streaming-io.platform.refinitiv.com/...`, and connecting to
`workspace.refinitiv.com` just errors with no message. The same element carries
the `token` the socket needs as a `?token=` query param.

```js
const cfg = JSON.parse(document.getElementById('jupyter-config-data').textContent);
// POST {name:'python3'} to cfg.baseUrl + 'api/kernels' with X-XSRFToken from the _xsrf cookie,
// then open:  `${cfg.wsUrl}api/kernels/${kernelId}/channels?token=${cfg.token}`
// send an execute_request on channel 'shell'; collect 'stream' msgs until status.execution_state === 'idle'
```

First load spawns the server ("Preparing your CodeBook environment", a minute or
two) and the URL sits at `/hub/spawn-pending/<user>` until ready. Shut the kernel
down (`DELETE api/kernels/<id>`) when finished; the server itself idle-culls.

`amers1` is the Americas region — read it from `cfg.wsUrl`, never hardcode it.

The full copy-pasteable recipe lives in **`references/codebook.md`** (added by
PR #95), together with the spawn/XSRF gotchas and why this failure mode is so
easy to misread: the wrong host returns *no* handshake response at all, which is
indistinguishable from a proxy blocking the upgrade.

## Date Awareness

When querying market data, account for current date context and market data lag.

### Market Data Lag

Market data typically has T-1 availability, meaning today’s data becomes available tomorrow. Adjust date ranges accordingly.

### Date Range Example

Use current date context when querying historical prices:

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Get recent market data
end_date = datetime.now()
start_date = end_date - timedelta(days=365)

# Adjust to exclude recent data (T-1 for market data availability)
end_date = end_date - timedelta(days=1)

df = ld.get_history(
    universe=”AAPL.O”,
    fields=[‘CLOSE’],
    start=start_date.strftime(‘%Y-%m-%d’),
    end=end_date.strftime(‘%Y-%m-%d’)
)
```

Remember: Always account for the T-1 lag in market data availability.
