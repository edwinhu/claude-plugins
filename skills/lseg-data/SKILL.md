# LSEG Data Library

Access financial data from LSEG (London Stock Exchange Group), formerly Refinitiv, via the `lseg.data` Python library **or** by driving the Workspace web client over CDP.

## Access Paths

Pick the lowest-numbered path that can serve the request.

| # | Path | Use for | Auth | Reference |
|---|------|---------|------|-----------|
| 1 | `lseg.data` Python library | anything it covers; batch and production work | RDP machine credentials | this file + `references/*` |
| 2 | Token-lift → RDP REST from Python | the same data with **no machine credentials** — borrows the browser session | Workspace tab's `edp-token` | `references/workspace-web-cdp.md` |
| 3 | In-page `fetch()` on the target origin | Workspace-internal endpoints only (SDC deal universes, FSCREEN) | browser cookies | `references/workspace-web-cdp.md` |

Path 1 remains preferred where it works — `pip install lseg-data` is available on every platform. Paths 2 and 3 exist because **some data is only reachable through the web client**, and because the token-lift avoids needing machine credentials at all.

**The desktop Workspace app is Windows/macOS only.** On Linux there is no desktop session and no Electron binary to launch with `--remote-debugging-port`; the web client at `https://workspace.refinitiv.com/web` is the only Workspace surface. Never emit a `session.desktop.workspace` config or an app path on Linux.

The helper for paths 2 and 3 is `scripts/workspace_cdp.py`:

```bash
python3 scripts/workspace_cdp.py token       # verify the browser session
python3 scripts/workspace_cdp.py datagrid --universe AAPL.O,MSFT.O \
        --fields TR.CommonName,TR.Revenue
```

```python
import sys; sys.path.insert(0, "scripts")
import workspace_cdp as w
df = w.datagrid_df(["AAPL.O"], ["TR.Revenue", "TR.Revenue.fperiod"],
                   {"SDate": "0", "EDate": "-4", "Frq": "FY"})
```

Requires Chromium on CDP port 9222 with a signed-in Workspace Web tab — see the `browser-automation` skill for the browser, and `references/workspace-web-cdp.md` for session setup.

## Query Enforcement

### IRON LAW: NO DATA CLAIM WITHOUT SAMPLE INSPECTION

Before claiming ANY LSEG query succeeded, follow these steps:
1. **VALIDATE** field names exist (check prefixes: TR., CF_)
2. **VALIDATE** RIC symbology is correct (.O, .N, .L, .T)
3. **EXECUTE** the query
4. **INSPECT** sample rows with `.head()` or `.sample()`
5. **VERIFY** critical columns are not NULL
6. **VERIFY** date range matches expectations
7. **CLAIM** success only after all checks pass

This is not negotiable. Skipping result inspection is NOT HELPFUL — the user builds analysis on data with undetected quality problems.

### LSEG API Facts

- The API does not raise errors for invalid field names or wrong RICs — it returns empty results or NULL columns. Treating returned rows as correct data is an unverified claim presented as fact: inspect for NULLs, wrong dates, and invalid values before returning anything.
- Field-name typos are common and fail silently (TR.EPS vs TR.Eps). Validate field names against the documentation before executing.
- User-supplied RICs often carry the wrong exchange suffix. Verify against the RIC Symbology section (`.O`, `.N`, `.L`, `.T`) before querying.
- Market data has T-1 availability — today's data arrives tomorrow. Querying through today produces silent gaps; see the Date Awareness section.
- Rate limits bind per session (500 requests/minute) and per request (`get_data()` 10,000 data points, `get_history()` 3,000 rows) — many small queries still hit the session cap. Batch instead of looping.

### Workspace Web / CDP Facts

- The lifted `edp-token` lives **~10 minutes**. A script that reads it once and runs for an hour dies mid-batch with a 401. `workspace_cdp.token()` re-reads within 60s of expiry — use it per request rather than caching the string.
- **Entitlements are per-account and cannot be enumerated** — the token's scopes are encrypted inside the JWT. On the verified account, news is `403 insufficient_scope` and CUSIP/ISIN symbology is unentitled. Probe the endpoint and read the error; never assume a dataset is available because it exists in the docs.
- **A 200 is not proof of success.** Symbology returns HTTP 200 with a per-identifier `errors` array when unentitled, and datagrid returns `null` data with `messages.codes` of `-2 ("empty")` for fields that do not apply. Read `errors` and `messages.codes`, not just the status line.
- Cross-origin `fetch()` from the Workspace tab is **CORS-blocked** and fails as a bare "Failed to fetch" that looks like a network outage. Workspace-internal endpoints must be called from a tab on their own origin — that is what `in_page_fetch()` does.
- Deal-level `SCREEN(U(IN(DEALS)) ...)` universes are **rejected by the public datagrid** (`error 218`) and only work through the internal datacloud endpoint via path 3.
- **Codebook could not execute code** on the one account/machine tested — the kernel WebSocket is killed before it reaches JupyterHub (no handshake response; a bogus kernel ID fails identically to a valid one), including through Codebook's own JupyterLab UI. Do not debug headers or subprotocols; the two things actually worth trying are a full session reset (clear site data + re-login) and a supported browser. Its contents/kernels REST API does work. See `references/codebook.md`.

### Red Flags — STOP If About To:

- Execute a query without validating field names and RIC suffixes first → STOP. The API will not error for you.
- Return a dataframe without `.head()` or `.sample()` inspection → STOP. Handing over uninspected data gives the user undetected quality problems — unhelpful on its own terms.
- Write a `session.desktop.workspace` config, or reference `/Applications/Refinitiv Workspace.app`, on Linux → STOP. There is no desktop session on this platform; the config will fail at connect time.
- Navigate or reload the user's signed-in Workspace tab → STOP. It destroys their layout and can drop the session that every CDP path depends on. Open your own tab instead.

### Data Validation Checklist

Before EVERY data retrieval claim, verify the following:

**For `ld.get_data()` (fundamentals/ESG):**
- [ ] Field names use correct prefix (TR. for Refinitiv)
- [ ] RIC symbology verified (correct exchange suffix)
- [ ] Result inspection: `.head()` or `.sample()` executed
- [ ] NULL check on critical fields (e.g., revenue, EPS)
- [ ] Row count verification (is result size reasonable?)
- [ ] Date context verified (fiscal periods, as-of dates)

**For `ld.get_history()` (time series):**
- [ ] Field names are valid (OPEN, HIGH, LOW, CLOSE, VOLUME, or CF_ prefixes)
- [ ] Start/end dates specified explicitly
- [ ] Date range adjusted for T-1 availability (market data lag)
- [ ] Result inspection: check first and last rows
- [ ] NULL check on OHLCV fields
- [ ] Date continuity check (gaps in trading days expected, but not in date sequence)

**For `symbol_conversion.Definition()` (mapping):**
- [ ] Input identifier type specified correctly
- [ ] Result inspection: verify mapped values exist
- [ ] NULL check (some securities may not have all identifiers)

**For ALL queries:**
- [ ] Rate limits considered (batch if >10k data points)
- [ ] Session management: `open_session()` at start, `close_session()` at end
- [ ] Error handling: try/except for network failures
- [ ] Sample inspection BEFORE claiming data is ready

## Quick Start

To get started with LSEG Data Library, initialize a session and execute queries:

```python
import lseg.data as ld

# Initialize session
ld.open_session()

# Get fundamentals
df = ld.get_data(
    universe=[‘AAPL.O’, ‘MSFT.O’],
    fields=[‘TR.CompanyName’, ‘TR.Revenue’, ‘TR.EPS’]
)
print(df.head())  # Inspect sample data

# Get historical prices
prices = ld.get_history(
    universe=’AAPL.O’,
    fields=[‘OPEN’, ‘HIGH’, ‘LOW’, ‘CLOSE’, ‘VOLUME’],
    start=‘2023-01-01’,
    end=‘2023-12-31’
)
print(prices.head())  # Inspect sample data

# Close session
ld.close_session()
```

## Authentication

Three options. The first two are for the `lseg.data` library; the third needs no credentials of your own.

**Platform session (works on every OS)** — config file or environment variables, below. This is the only `lseg.data` session type available on Linux.

**Desktop session** — requires the Refinitiv Workspace desktop app running locally. Windows/macOS only; not an option on Linux.

**Borrowed browser session** — no credentials at all: `scripts/workspace_cdp.py` lifts the access token out of a signed-in Workspace Web tab. Use this when machine credentials are unavailable or expired. See `references/workspace-web-cdp.md`.

### Config File Method

Create `lseg-data.config.json`:
```json
{
  “sessions”: {
    “default”: “platform.ldp”,
    “platform”: {
      “ldp”: {
        “app-key”: “YOUR_APP_KEY”,
        “username”: “YOUR_MACHINE_ID”,
        “password”: “YOUR_PASSWORD”
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Environment Variables Method

Set the following environment variables for LSEG authentication:

```bash
# Configure LSEG credentials via environment variables
export RDP_USERNAME=”YOUR_MACHINE_ID”
export RDP_PASSWORD=”YOUR_PASSWORD”
export RDP_APP_KEY=”YOUR_APP_KEY”
```

### Scripts

- **`scripts/test_connection.py`** - Validate connectivity. No args tests the `lseg.data` platform session; `--browser` tests the CDP/Workspace-Web path.
- **`scripts/workspace_cdp.py`** - Drive Workspace Web over CDP: `token`, `datagrid`, `history`, `symbology`, `search`, `sdc-screen`, `deal-data`, `fetch`. Importable as a module or usable as a CLI.

Deal-level SDC work is two steps — `sdc_deal_ids()` resolves a `SCREEN(U(IN(DEALS)) ...)` universe to deal IDs, then `deal_data()` fetches field values for them as `<id>@DEALID`. See `references/workspace-web-cdp.md`.

### Refinitiv Codebook

Hosted JupyterLab with a pre-authenticated, fully entitled `refinitiv.data` session:

- **URL**: `https://workspace.refinitiv.com/codebook/`
- **Environment**: JupyterHub 1.5.0dev, kernels `python3` and `python3_legacy`
- **Session**: auto-authenticated via Workspace cookies (`{name='codebook'}`)

```python
# Inside a Codebook notebook, the session opens with Workspace auth
import refinitiv.data as rd
rd.open_session()                                   # name='codebook'
df = rd.news.get_headlines('R:AAPL.O AND SUGGAC', count=10)
```

**Codebook cannot be driven for computation.** Its contents/kernels/sessions REST API works with the browser's cookies, but the kernel WebSocket is refused server-side (close 1006) — including through Codebook's own JupyterLab UI, where a submitted cell sits at `[*]` forever. Use it as a file exchange (push a notebook, the user runs it, pull back the outputs) and read the user's existing notebooks as worked examples. Full detail and the re-test diagnostic: `references/codebook.md`.

**Note**: Codebook uses `refinitiv.data` (older name) rather than `lseg.data`. Both APIs are equivalent.

## Date Awareness

When querying market data, account for current date context and market data lag.

### Market Data Lag

Market data typically has T-1 availability, meaning today’s data becomes available tomorrow. Adjust date ranges accordingly.

### Date Range Example

Use current date context when querying historical prices:

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Get recent market data
end_date = datetime.now()
start_date = end_date - timedelta(days=365)

# Adjust to exclude recent data (T-1 for market data availability)
end_date = end_date - timedelta(days=1)

df = ld.get_history(
    universe=”AAPL.O”,
    fields=[‘CLOSE’],
    start=start_date.strftime(‘%Y-%m-%d’),
    end=end_date.strftime(‘%Y-%m-%d’)
)
```

Remember: Always account for the T-1 lag in market data availability.
