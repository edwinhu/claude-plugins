# Law & Economics DOCX Export

Build a submission-ready Word manuscript from markdown for the Chicago-style
law-and-economics journals (JLE, JLS, JLEO, ALER) and for job market papers
written for that audience.

**These journals publish no official Word template.** Their instructions amount
to "double spaced throughout, Chicago Manual of Style, author-date with a
reference list," and every template circulating online is third-party and
mutually inconsistent. This skill is that missing template plus the pipeline
that drives it.

## Iron Law: never hand-roll the pandoc call

**NO L&E .docx WITHOUT `build_le_docx.py`.** A bare `pandoc -o out.docx` gives
Calibri, single spacing, no reference list, numbered headings that collide with
the back matter, and pandoc's grid-bordered tables — a document that looks
finished and violates four separate JLE requirements. Reaching for raw pandoc to
"just get something quickly" is the efficiency drive producing an unusable
deliverable; it is slower than the script, not faster.

Agents **without the `Skill` tool** (most workflow subagents) can't invoke this
skill — run the script directly.

## Usage

```bash
uv run python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/build_le_docx.py PAPER.md [-o OUT.docx] [--pdf]
uv run python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/build_le_docx.py PROJECT_DIR      # drafts/*.md in numeric order
```

| Flag | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `--acknowledgement "..."` | Injects the unnumbered `*` acknowledgment note. **JLE requires one**, placed before note 1. |
| `--bibliography FILE` | Default: `references/sources.bib`, `references.bib`, or `sources.bib` beside the source. |
| `--csl FILE` | Default: the vendored `assets/chicago-author-date.csl` (CMOS 18e author-date). |
| `--spacing onehalf\|single` | **Internal circulation only.** Double is the JLE submission requirement and the default. |
| `--pdf` | Renders via `doc_render.convert` after building. |

The build: assembles sources (first file's YAML frontmatter becomes the document
metadata, later files' footnote labels are namespaced), resolves
`<!-- include: /abs/path.md -->` sentinels, guarantees a `::: {#refs}` reference
list, runs pandoc with `--citeproc` + `pandoc-crossref` + the L&E reference doc,
then retags back-matter headings, forces widow control, and restyles tables to
booktabs.

## Metadata (YAML frontmatter of the first file)

```yaml
---
title: "Deterrence without Detection"
author:
  - "Isabelle Marchand, University of Chicago Law School, imarchand@uchicago.edu"
  - "A. N. Coauthor, Northwestern University, coauthor@northwestern.edu"
date: "January 2026"
abstract: |
  ... 150 words maximum, strictly enforced by the journal ...
---
```

JLE requires the title page to carry names, e-mail addresses, **and**
affiliations — put all three in each `author` entry. The build warns if the
abstract exceeds 150 words.

## What the template encodes

Full editorial spec — subhead ladder, citation forms, table/figure rules,
appendix numbering — is in **`references/jle-house-style.md`**. Read it before
answering any "how should X be formatted" question; do not answer from memory.

| Style | Use | Formatting |
|-------|-----|------------|
| `Title` / `Author` / `Date` | Title page | Centered; 14pt bold title |
| `Abstract Title` / `Abstract` | Abstract block | Bold centered head; indented body |
| `Heading 1` | `1.` Section | **Bold**, auto-numbered |
| `Heading 2` | `1.1.` Subsection | *Italic*, auto-numbered |
| `Heading 3` | `1.1.1.` Sub-subsection | Roman, auto-numbered |
| `Heading 4` | Run-in head | *Italic*, keepNext |
| `Unnumbered Heading` | Abstract / References / Appendix | Bold, **no** section number |
| `Body Text` / `First Paragraph` | Body | First-line indent; no indent after a heading |
| `Footnote Text` | Footnotes | 12pt, **double spaced** |
| `Bibliography` | Reference list | Hanging indent, double spaced |
| `Table Note` | Note under a table | Double spaced |

Everything is Latin Modern Roman at 12pt, double spaced, on US Letter with 1-inch
margins and a centered page-number footer. Math is OMML with `Latin Modern Math`
as the math font, so `$...$` and `$$...$$` render as real Word equations.

**Section numbers come from Word list numbering.** Write `# Introduction`, never
`# 1. Introduction`.

## Provenance of the typography — and what survived

The typography comes from **WordTeX** (`tomwildenhain.com/wordtex`). Its
`WordTeX Template.dotx` turned out to be a **pandoc-shaped style set already** —
`Compact`, `Author`, `Abstract`, `BlockText`, `FootnoteText`, `TableCaption`,
`CaptionedFigure`, `SourceCode`, `VerbatimChar` are all pandoc styleIds, and the
theme fonts are LM Roman 10 / Latin Modern Math. So the styles extracted
cleanly; no hand-rebuild fallback was needed.

What we did **not** take: the `.dot`/VSTO plugin, glossary/AutoText, and
autocorrect macros. Those are for *authoring* in Word; pandoc needs a plain
`.docx` that merely *carries* style definitions.

Where JLE and WordTeX conflict, **JLE wins**, and the divergence is commented in
`scripts/make_le_template.py`:

| WordTeX (LaTeX look) | Template (JLE) | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `w:line="204"` (tight LaTeX leading) | `w:line="480"` (double) | "double spaced throughout" |
| 11pt body, 8pt footnotes, 10pt abstract | 12pt everywhere | "including footnotes, tables, and figure legends" |
| Justified (`jc=both`) | Flush left | Chicago manuscript prep; justified + double spaced opens rivers |
| Numbered `Bibliography` list | Hanging-indent reference list | Author-date, not numbered references |

## Regenerating the template

The `.docx` is **built, not hand-edited**, so every choice is auditable in one file:

```bash
uv run python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/make_le_template.py
```

It starts from `pandoc --print-default-data-file reference.docx` (guaranteeing
every part and styleId pandoc's writer emits is present), transplants the
Latin Modern typography, adds the JLE heading numbering and page-number footer,
and self-verifies. Output:
`${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../writing-legal/templates/law_econ_template.docx`.

**Never open the template in Word and save it.** Change `make_le_template.py`
and regenerate.

## Round-trip check

`examples/sample/` is a small paper exercising headings, a table with a note, a
figure, display + inline math, footnotes, and author-date cites:

```bash
uv run python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/build_le_docx.py \
    ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/examples/sample/paper.md -o /tmp/sample.docx --pdf
```

## Known limitation: math in the headless PDF path

The build stamps `Latin Modern Math` both in `settings.xml` (`m:mathFont`) and on
every OMML run. **Word honors it; LibreOffice does not** — it converts OMML to
its own formula objects and uses its configured math font, so a Linux headless
render shows Latin Modern body text next to Liberation Serif math. x2t is worse
here (it misses Latin Modern entirely and falls back to Liberation Sans).

The .docx is correct; only the LibreOffice *preview* is off. Render the
submission PDF with `--renderer word`. Verified on the sample: body text is
`LMRoman10-Regular/Bold/Italic`, math is the only fallback.

**Do not try to fix this by installing fonts or configuring LibreOffice — both
have been tested and neither works.**

| Attempted fix | Result |
|---|---|
| Install Latin Modern Math system-wide | No effect. The font is typically **already installed** (TeX/LaTeX pulls it in) and `fc-match "Latin Modern Math"` resolves to the real `latinmodern-math.otf`. Availability was never the problem. |
| Override LO's Math module default fonts (`/org.openoffice.Office.Math/Font` → `Variables`, `Functions`, `Numbers`, `Text`) | No effect. Re-rendered with those forced to `Latin Modern Math` in a clean LO profile; **byte-identical font list**. The OOXML import fixes formula fonts at import time and consults neither `m:mathFont` nor the Math defaults. |

To confirm the fallback is math-only rather than a document-wide problem, map
glyphs to fonts instead of trusting `pdffonts` (which ignores `-f`/`-l` and
reports the whole document for every page) or a vision check (which misjudges
double spacing):

```bash
uv run --with pdfplumber python3 -c "
import pdfplumber, collections
for i, pg in enumerate(pdfplumber.open('OUT.pdf').pages, 1):
    d = collections.defaultdict(str)
    for ch in pg.chars: d[ch['fontname'].split('+')[-1]] += ch['text']
    print(i, {f: (len(t) if 'LMRoman' in f else t[:60]) for f, t in d.items()})"
```

Expected: `LiberationSerif` carries **only** math glyphs (`π ρ ∂ > = +` etc.) and
appears **only** on pages with equations. `OpenSymbol` on page 1 is the `*`
acknowledgment marker, not a fallback. If Liberation shows up on a page with no
math, something else is wrong — that is a real bug, not this limitation.

Spacing is likewise verified from the XML, not by eye: every relevant style
(`BodyText`, `FirstParagraph`, `FootnoteText`, `Bibliography`, `Abstract`,
`TableNote`) must carry `w:line="480"` (double); `240` would be single.

### Getting a correct-math PDF from a Linux box

You do **not** need a Word VM. Options, in order of practicality:

1. **Ship the .docx.** JLE/JLS/JLEO take Word submissions. The math is correct in
   the file; the editor's Word renders it in Latin Modern. The bad preview never
   reaches anyone.
2. **Render on a Mac that has Word** — but **not over SSH**: macOS TCC blocks it
   and cmux dispatch can't rescue a remote invocation. Run it from the Mac's GUI
   login session, or grant Full Disk Access to sshd. See the **docx-render**
   skill, "Driving the Mac's Word from another machine over SSH."
3. **LaTeX preview for reading only.** `tectonic` (or xelatex) via pandoc gives
   typographically faithful Latin Modern math on Linux. Use it to *read* the
   paper; it is **not** the submission artifact and diverges from the .docx.

## Verification gate — before you claim the build is done

IDENTIFY the output → RUN the render → READ the pages → VERIFY → CLAIM.

1. Render: `python3 scripts/doc_render.py OUT.docx OUT.pdf` (`--renderer word`
   for anything a human reads — see the **docx-render** skill's Iron Law).
2. Rasterize: `pdftoppm -r 110 -png OUT.pdf pg`.
3. **Look at the pages** with the **visual-verify** skill. Check: body font is
   Computer Modern (not a Times fallback); lines are double spaced; sections read
   `1.`, `1.1.`; References and Appendix headings carry **no** number; the table
   is a real grid with booktabs rules and no word broken mid-token; the figure
   rendered; the `*` acknowledgment note is on page 1.
4. Only then report the path.

**`pandoc` exiting 0 is not verification.** It exits 0 on a document with a
missing figure, a collapsed table, and Calibri fallback.

| Action | Why Wrong | Do Instead |
|--------|-----------|------------|
| About to run `pandoc -o out.docx` yourself → **STOP** | No template, no citeproc, no reference list; wrong on four JLE requirements at once | `build_le_docx.py` |
| About to use `law-review-docx` for an L&E paper → **STOP** | Footnote/Bluebook citations, small caps, TOC — wrong discipline and wrong citation model | This skill |
| About to write `# 1. Introduction` → **STOP** | Word adds its own number: "1. 1. Introduction" | `# Introduction` |
| About to put a bare citation in a footnote → **STOP** | JLE: footnotes must be substantive; simple citations go in the text | `[@key]` inline |
| About to add cases to the `.bib` → **STOP** | JLE: "Do not include cases in the reference list" | Cite in text: `(332 U.S. 392 [1947])` |
| About to build with `--spacing single` for a submission → **STOP** | Desk-reject risk; double spacing is explicit and non-negotiable | Default `double` |
| About to report success on "pandoc exited 0" → **STOP** | Exit 0 hides missing figures and collapsed tables | Run the verification gate |
| About to edit the template in Word → **STOP** | Next regeneration silently reverts it | Edit `make_le_template.py` |
