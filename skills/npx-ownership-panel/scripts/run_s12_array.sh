# Replaces the sequential loop in split_s12.sas, which wrote all nine partitions
# from one job (measured 910s / 15m10s). Two waves of <=6 recover most of that.
#
# -tc 6 IS LOAD-BEARING, NOT TUNING. Each task opens its own PostgreSQL
# connection and the WRDS per-role cap is 7:
#     select rolconnlimit from pg_roles where rolname = current_user;   -- 7
# Nine concurrent tasks exceed it. 6 leaves one connection of headroom, so the
# array does not fail whenever an interactive session or a stray psql is also
# connected — sizing to exactly 7 turns that into an intermittent failure that
# passes on the run where you test it.
