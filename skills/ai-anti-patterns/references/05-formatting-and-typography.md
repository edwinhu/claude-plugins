# Formatting and Typography

## Excessive use of boldface

AI chatbots may display various phrases in [boldface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boldface "Boldface") for emphasis in an excessive, mechanical manner. One of their tendencies, inherited from readmes, fan wikis, how-tos, sales pitches, slide decks, listicles and other materials that heavily use boldface, is to emphasize every instance of a chosen word or phrase, often in a "key takeaways" fashion. Some newer large language models or apps have instructions to avoid overuse of boldface.

**Examples**

> It blends **OKRs (Objectives and Key Results)**, **KPIs (Key Performance Indicators)**, and visual strategy tools such as the **Business Model Canvas (BMC)** and **Balanced Scorecard (BSC)**. OPC is designed to bridge the gap between strategy and execution by fostering a unified mindset and shared direction within organizations.

## Inline-header vertical lists

AI chatbots' content often includes vertical lists. A particular list formatting is employed: It comprises an ordered or unordered list where the list marker (number, bullet, dash, etc.) is followed by an inline boldfaced header of sorts; a colon then separates it from the remaining descriptive text. (Separately from this sign, this is one of the things which cause overabundant boldfacing; see [§ Excessive use of boldface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#Excessive_use_of_boldface))

Instead of [proper wikitext](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H:LIST "H:LIST"), a bullet point in an unordered list may appear as a bullet character (•), hyphen (-), en dash (–), or similar character. Ordered lists (i.e. numbered lists) may use explicit numbers (such as `1.`) instead of standard wikitext. When [copied as bare text appearing on the screen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:SCOPY "Wikipedia:SCOPY"), some of the formatting information is lost, and line breaks may be lost as well.

## Emojis

Sometimes, AI chatbots decorate section headings or bullet points by placing [emojis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoji "Emoji") in front of them.

## Em dashes

While human editors and writers often do use [em dashes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Em_dash "Em dash") (—), LLM output tends to use them more often than nonprofessional human-written text of the same genre, and uses them in places where humans are more likely to use commas, parentheses, colons, or (misused) hyphens (-). LLMs especially tend to use em dashes in a formulaic, pat way, often mimicking "punched up" sales-like writing by over-emphasizing clauses or parallelisms. LLMs overuse em dashes because they were trained (sometimes illegally) on novels, and novelists have always used em dashes more often than is typical of a layperson.

This sign is most useful when taken in combination with other indicators, not by itself.

**Examples**

> Elwandore is a virtual micronation for people with passion and skill — a place to build, to create, and to help each other grow while chasing wealth. But not wealth for greed — wealth to give, to help others, to donate.

> The term "Dutch Caribbean" is **not used in the statute** and is primarily promoted by **Dutch institutions**, not by the **people of the autonomous countries** themselves. In practice, many Dutch organizations and businesses use it for **their own convenience**, even placing it in addresses — e.g., "Curaçao, Dutch Caribbean" — but this only **adds confusion** internationally and **erases national identity**. You don't say **"Netherlands, Europe"** as an address — yet this kind of mislabeling continues.
