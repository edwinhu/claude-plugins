# Template Artifacts

## Phrasal templates and placeholder text

AI chatbots may generate responses with fill-in-the-blank [phrasal templates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrasal_template "Phrasal template") (as seen in the game *[Mad Libs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Libs "Mad Libs")*) for the LLM user to replace with words and phrases pertaining to their use case. However, some LLM users forget to fill in those blanks. Note that non-LLM-generated templates exist for drafts and new articles, such as [Wikipedia:Artist biography article template/Preload](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Artist_biography_article_template/Preload "Wikipedia:Artist biography article template/Preload") and pages in [Category:Article creation templates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Article_creation_templates "Category:Article creation templates").

Large-language models may also insert placeholder dates like "2025-xx-xx" into citation fields, particularly the access-date parameter and [rarely the date parameter as well](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:PermanentLink/1295449767#References "Special:PermanentLink/1295449767"), producing errors.
