# Structural Patterns

## Section summaries

|  | Words to watch: ***In summary*, *In conclusion*, *Overall*...** |
| --- | --- |

When generating longer outputs (such as when told to "write an article"), LLMs often add a section titled "Conclusion" or similar, and will often end a paragraph or section by summarizing and restating its core idea.[^10]

**Examples**

> ==In summary==, the educational and training trajectory for nurse scientists typically involves a progression from a master's degree in nursing to a Doctor of Philosophy in Nursing, followed by postdoctoral training in nursing research. This structured pathway ensures that nurse scientists acquire the necessary knowledge and skills to engage in rigorous research and contribute meaningfully to the advancement of nursing science.

| --- | --- |

Many LLM-generated Wikipedia articles include a "Challenges" section, which typically begins with a sentence like "Despite its \[positive/promotional words\], \[article subject\] faces challenges..." and ends with either a vaguely positive assessment of the article subject [^6], or speculation about how ongoing or potential initiatives could benefit the subject. Such paragraphs usually appear at the end of articles with a rigid outline structure, which may also include a separate section for "Future Prospects."

Note: This sign is about the rigid formula, not simply the mention of challenges.

**Examples**

> ==Despite its industrial and residential prosperity, Korattur faces challenges== typical of urban areas, including\[...\] With its ==strategic location and ongoing initiatives==, Korattur ==continues to thrive== as an integral part of the Ambattur industrial zone, embodying the synergy between industry and residential living.

> ==Despite its success, the Panama Canal faces challenges==, including\[...\] ==Future investments in technology, such as automated navigation systems, and potential further expansions could enhance the canal's efficiency== and maintain its relevance in global trade.

> ==Despite their promising applications, pyroelectric materials face several challenges== that must be addressed for broader adoption. One key limitation is\[...\] ==Despite these challenges==, the versatility of pyroelectric materials ==positions them as critical components== for sustainable energy solutions and next-generation sensor technologies.

## Negative parallelisms

Parallel constructions involving "not", "but", or "however" such as " Not only... but..." or " It is not just about..., it's..." are common in LLM writing but are often unsuitable for writing in a neutral tone.[^6]

**Examples**

> **Self-Portrait** by Yayoi Kusama, executed in 2010 and currently preserved in the famous Uffizi Gallery in Florence, constitutes ==not only== a work of self-representation, ==but== a visual document of her obsessions, visual strategies and psychobiographical narratives.

— From [this revision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Diff/1288184349 "Special:Diff/1288184349") to [Self-portrait (Yayoi Kusama)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-portrait_\(Yayoi_Kusama\) "Self-portrait (Yayoi Kusama)")

> It's ==not just about== the beat riding under the vocals; ==it's== part of the aggression and atmosphere.

Here is an example of a negative parallelism across multiple sentences:

> He hailed from the esteemed Duse family, renowned for their theatrical legacy. Eugenio's life, however, took a path that intertwined both personal ambition and familial complexities.

— From [this revision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Diff/1284729136 "Special:Diff/1284729136") to [Eugenio Duse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugenio_Duse "Eugenio Duse")

On rare occasions, user messages that appear AI-generated may also include phrases that read along the lines of " no..., no..., just...".

**Examples**

> There are ==no== long-form profiles. ==No== editorial insights. ==No== coverage of her game dev career. ==No== notable accolades. ==Just== TikTok recaps and callouts.
>
> ---
>
> This page should be gone, fully, cleanly, and without delay. ==No== redirect. ==No== merge. ==Just== delete.

> I'm hitting the reset button — ==no== hard feelings, ==no== drama — ==just== clean, policy-based engagement from here on out.

LLMs overuse the ' [rule of three](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_three_\(writing\) "Rule of three (writing)") '—"the good, the bad, and the ugly". This can take different forms from "adjective, adjective, adjective" to "short phrase, short phrase, and short phrase".[^6] LLMs often use this structure to make [superficial analyses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#Superficial_analyses) appear more comprehensive.

**Examples**

> The Amaze Conference brings together ==global SEO professionals, marketing experts, and growth hackers== to discuss the latest trends in digital marketing. The event features ==keynote sessions, panel discussions, and networking opportunities==.

AI chatbots tend to attribute opinions or claims to some vague authority—a practice called [weasel wording](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weasel_wording "Weasel wording") —while citing only one or two sources that may or may not actually express such view. They also tend to overgeneralize a perspective of one or few sources into that of a wider group.

**Examples**

Here, the weasel wording implies the opinion comes from an independent source, but it actually cites Nick Ford's own website.

> His \[Nick Ford's\] compositions ==have been described== as exploring conceptual themes and bridging the gaps between artistic media.[^1]

> Due to its unique characteristics, the Haolai River is of interest to ==researchers and conservationists==. Efforts are ongoing to monitor its ecological health and preserve the surrounding grassland environment, which is part of a larger initiative to protect China's semi-arid ecosystems from degradation.
