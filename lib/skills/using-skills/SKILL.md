# Using Skills

**Invoke relevant skills BEFORE any response or action.**

This is non-negotiable. Even a 1% chance a skill applies requires checking.

## CRITICAL: Skill Already Loaded - DO NOT RE-INVOKE

<EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>
**If you see a skill name in the current conversation turn (e.g., `<command-name>/dev</command-name>`), the skill is ALREADY LOADED.**

**DO NOT:**
- ❌ Use the Skill tool to invoke it again
- ❌ Say "I need to invoke the skill"
- ❌ Call `Skill(skill="dev")` or similar

**DO INSTEAD:**
- ✅ The skill instructions follow immediately in the next message
- ✅ Just proceed to the next step
- ✅ Follow the loaded skill's instructions directly

**If you catch yourself about to invoke a skill that's already loaded, STOP. Just go to the next step.**
</EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>

## The Rule

```
User message arrives
    ↓
Is user explicitly invoking a skill (e.g., "use /dev")?
    ↓
YES → SKILL IS ALREADY LOADED
      ↓
      DO NOT invoke again with Skill tool
      ↓
      Proceed to next step (follow skill instructions)
NO  → Check: Does this match any skill trigger?
    ↓
YES → Invoke skill FIRST, then follow its protocol
NO  → Proceed normally
```

## Workflow Commands (User Must Invoke Explicitly)

These are commands, not auto-triggered skills. User must explicitly type the command:

| Command | Purpose | User Types |
|---------|---------|------------|
| `/dev` | Feature development workflow (7 phases) | `/dev` |
| `/ds` | Data analysis workflow (5 phases) | `/ds` |

## Skill Triggers (Can Auto-Invoke)

| User Intent | Skill | Trigger Words |
|-------------|-------|---------------|
| Bug/fix | `dev-debug` | bug, broken, fix, doesn't work, crash, error, fails |
| Writing | `writing` | write, draft, document, essay, paper |
| **Media analysis** | **look-at** | describe image, analyze PDF, what's in this, screenshot, diagram |

## Red Flags - You're Skipping the Skill Check

If you think any of these, STOP:

| Thought | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| **"I need to invoke the skill properly"** | **If user said "use /dev", it's ALREADY LOADED. Just proceed.** |
| **"Let me invoke the skill first"** | **Check for `<command-name>` tag - it's already loaded if present** |
| **"I should use Skill tool for /dev"** | **NO. User invocation = already loaded = proceed to next step** |
| "This is just a simple question" | Simple questions don't involve reading code |
| "I'll gather information first" | That IS investigation - use the skill |
| "I know exactly what to do" | The skill provides structure you'll miss |
| "It's just one file" | Scope doesn't exempt you from process |
| "Let me quickly check..." | "Quickly" means skipping the workflow |
| **"I can read this image directly"** | **Use look-at to save context tokens** |

## Bug Reports - Mandatory Response

When user mentions a bug:

```
DO NOT:
1. Read code files
2. Investigate independently
3. "Take a look" without structure

INSTEAD:
1. Start ralph loop:
   ralph-loop: Start Ralph Loop in current session with bug debugging
   Skill(skill="ralph-loop:ralph-loop", args="Debug: [symptom] --max-iterations 15 --completion-promise FIXED")
2. Inside loop, follow /dev-debug protocol
```

**Any code reading before starting the workflow is a violation.**

## Skill Priority

When multiple skills could apply:

1. **Process skills first** - debugging, brainstorming determine approach
2. **Then implementation** - dev, ds, writing execute the approach

## How to Invoke

Use the Skill tool to invoke skills:

```bash
# dev-debug: Systematic bug investigation and fixing with verification-driven methodology
Skill(skill="dev-debug")

# dev: Feature development workflow with 7 phases and TDD enforcement
Skill(skill="dev")

# ds: Data analysis workflow with 5 phases and output-first verification
Skill(skill="ds")
```

Or start ralph loop first for implementation/debug phases:

```bash
# ralph-loop: Per-task ralph loop pattern for implementation and debugging
Skill(skill="ralph-loop:ralph-loop", args="Task description --max-iterations 15")
```

## IRON LAW: Multimodal File Analysis

**NO READING IMAGES/PDFS WITH Read TOOL. USE look-at INSTEAD.**

### The Rule

```
User asks about image/PDF/media content
    ↓
Is it a media file requiring interpretation?
    ↓
YES → Use look-at skill (bash call to look_at.py)
NO  → Use Read tool for source code/text
```

### When to Use look-at

**ALWAYS use look-at for:**
- `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.webp`, `.gif`, `.heic` - Images
- `.pdf` - PDFs requiring content extraction
- `.mp4`, `.mov`, `.avi`, `.webm` - Videos
- `.mp3`, `.wav`, `.aac`, `.ogg` - Audio
- Any file where you need to UNDERSTAND content, not just see raw bytes

**Pattern:**
```bash
# look-at: Extract information from media file with specific goal
python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/look-at/scripts/look_at.py \
    --file "/absolute/path/to/file" \
    --goal "What specific information to extract"
```

### When NOT to Use look-at

**Use Read tool instead for:**
- Source code files (`.py`, `.js`, `.rs`, etc.) - need exact formatting for editing
- Plain text files (`.txt`, `.md`, `.json`, etc.) - preserve exact content
- Config files requiring exact formatting preservation
- Any file that needs editing after reading

### Rationalization Table - STOP If You Think:

| Excuse | Reality | Do Instead |
|--------|---------|------------|
| "I can read images directly" | Read tool shows you the image, but wastes context tokens | Use look-at to extract ONLY what's needed |
| "It's just one small image" | Still uses 1000+ tokens in conversation context | look-at returns 50-200 tokens of extracted info |
| "I need to see the whole thing" | You can see it, user can't see what you see | Use look-at with specific goal |
| "look-at might miss details" | You can always fall back to Read if needed | Start with look-at, escalate if insufficient |
| "The user didn't ask for look-at" | look-at is FOR YOU, not the user | Use the right tool for the job |

### Red Flags - STOP If You Catch Yourself:

- **"Let me read this image..."** → NO. Use look-at.
- **"I'll use Read to see what's in the PDF..."** → NO. Use look-at.
- **"Just quickly checking this screenshot..."** → NO. Use look-at.
- **Passing image path to Read tool** → STOP. Use look-at instead.

### Cost & Context Benefits

- **Read tool on image:** ~1,000-5,000 context tokens
- **look-at extraction:** ~50-200 output tokens
- **Savings:** 95%+ token reduction
- **Speed:** Faster responses, less context bloat

### Example Usage

```bash
# look-at: Extract specific information from image file
python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/look-at/scripts/look_at.py \
    --file "$HOME/Downloads/screenshot.png" \
    --goal "List all buttons and their labels"

# look-at: Analyze diagram to understand data flow
python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/look-at/scripts/look_at.py \
    --file "$HOME/Documents/architecture.png" \
    --goal "Explain the data flow between components"

# look-at: Extract information from PDF document
python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/look-at/scripts/look_at.py \
    --file "$HOME/Downloads/report.pdf" \
    --goal "Extract the executive summary section"
```

### Enforcement

**Using Read on images/PDFs when look-at should be used results in:**
1. Wasting context tokens unnecessarily
2. Making conversations slower
3. Ignoring available optimization tools
4. Violating the tool selection protocol

**Validate before calling Read:** Ask "Is this a media file?" If yes, invoke look-at instead.

## IRON LAW: Following Skill Instructions

**WHEN A SKILL LOADS, YOU MUST FOLLOW ITS EXACT INSTRUCTIONS.**

Skills contain specific patterns, required parameters, and enforcement rules. Skipping these requirements defeats the purpose of loading the skill.

### The Rule

```
Skill loads successfully
    ↓
Read the skill's requirements carefully
    ↓
Follow ALL instructions, including:
    - Required tool parameters (descriptions, timeouts, etc.)
    - Specific command patterns
    - Enforcement patterns (Iron Laws, Red Flags)
    - Step sequences
    ↓
Execute using the skill's exact patterns
```

### Common Violations

**Bash Description Parameter:**

When a skill requires `description` parameter on Bash calls (like look-at), you MUST include it:

```bash
# ❌ WRONG: No description parameter
python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/look-at/scripts/look_at.py \
    --file "/path/to/file.pdf" \
    --goal "Extract title"

# ✅ CORRECT: With description parameter as skill requires
Bash(
    command='python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/look-at/scripts/look_at.py --file "/path/to/file.pdf" --goal "Extract title"',
    description="look-at: Extract title"
)
```

### Rationalization Table - STOP If You Think:

| Excuse | Reality | Do Instead |
|--------|---------|------------|
| "The skill is just guidance" | Skills contain tested, required patterns | Follow the skill's exact instructions |
| "I know a better way" | Your way skips enforcement or optimization | Use the skill's pattern - it exists for a reason |
| "Description parameter is optional" | When skill says REQUIRED, it's required | Add the description parameter as instructed |
| "I'll add it if it fails" | You'll clutter the conversation with messy output first | Follow the pattern from the start |
| "It's just cosmetic" | Clean descriptions improve UX and debugging | Professional output requires following the pattern |

### Red Flags - STOP If You Catch Yourself:

- **About to call Bash without description when skill requires it** → STOP. Add the description parameter.
- **Thinking "I'll skip this requirement"** → STOP. Skills don't have optional requirements.
- **"The skill says to do X but I'll do Y"** → STOP. Follow the skill or don't load it.
- **Modifying the skill's pattern "to be simpler"** → STOP. The pattern exists for a reason.

### Why This Matters

**Skills encode:**
1. **Tested patterns** - Proven to work in production
2. **Optimization** - Context/token savings, clean output
3. **Enforcement** - Prevent common mistakes
4. **UX standards** - Consistent, professional output

**When you skip skill instructions:**
- ❌ You waste the effort of loading the skill
- ❌ You create messy, unprofessional output
- ❌ You miss optimizations (context savings, speed)
- ❌ You violate user expectations
- ❌ You make debugging harder

**The skill loaded for a reason - follow it completely.**
