"""Ownership data-quality detector tests.

Run: uv run python3 tests/ownership_dq_test.py

Each defect class below was either measured on the mirror panel (~/projects/mirror) or
documented by a WRDS research note. The fixtures reproduce the measured *shape* with
synthetic numbers so the suite runs without WRDS credentials, and every detector is
tested twice: it must fire on the defect and stay silent on a clean panel. A detector
that only ever fires is not a test, it is an alarm.

Findings are labelled F1-F5 to match the investigation notes:
  F1  Thomson s34 AAPL: 4.5x seasonal share swing, owner count flat  (UNDIAGNOSED -> now diagnosed)
  F2  EDGAR 13F is clean where Thomson is not                        (control)
  F3  S12 looks healthier but is unverified                          (weak-signal case)
  F4  13F `value` changes units at 2023Q1, non-uniformly
  F5  Windows-1252 filings parsed to zero holdings rows
